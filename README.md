# NoCarJack

### Version

1.0.0

### Description

Yet pretty simple, but it should be efficient against the annoying NPC car-jacking and car stealing on roleplay based severs. This will force your players to find other means to reach their destination. The ability to steal cars is based on a chance factor.

### Features

It should:
* Work on all vehicles (cars,bikes,trucks,helicopters,planes,boats,...)
* Prevent parked vehicle stealing
* Prevent any kind of grand theft auto (car-jacking, passenger car-jack, etc)
* Define vehicle stealing/car-jacking possibilities by a chance in client.lua
* Be compatible with any vehicle control script
* Enable me to add whatever other feature you like that makes sense in the scope of this script

### Installation

1) Put the folder nocarjack_lua in your resources folder
2) Add "start nocarjack_lua" to your server.cfg
3) Restart server
